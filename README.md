## Digital-Pharmacy-Mobile-App-Prototype

# Introduction:
This repository contains a presentation explaining business needs,current workflow ,proposed solution for the problema and a high-level overview of what the Figma prototype. For the suggested solution (Mobile Application)  high fidelity prototype mock up screens were created to automate all the manual steps for better busines outcome and provide an enhanced end user experience.

# Dataset: 
The dataset used in this project is related to a Online Pharmacy Industry which included information about number of current customers , with their demographic details , subcriptions, dates of enrollment, payment methods, etc.Google Analytics Report for Company's website was also used to analyze data related to current website and gain more information about end users.

# Content:
Powerpoint Presentation and a hyperlink to the Figma prototype embedded within, so that users can access and interact with it.

# Project Overview:
For this initiative, we harnessed customer enrollment data to glean insights into the existing workflow. We leveraged established business analysis principles, encompassing the documentation of requirements using standardized formats. These requirements covered functional aspects, user stories, acceptance criteria, and non-functional specifications. Moreover, we engaged in active dialogue with stakeholders, holding meetings to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the situation. This included a thorough gap analysis to identify areas where the current processes or systems fell short of aligning with the predefined objectives and requirements.This meticulous examination and assessment of the situation enabled us to uncover valuable insights for potential enhancements in the processes. It was subsequently recommended that a mobile application be adopted as the most practical solution for automating the current workflow, with the primary aim of enhancing the end-user experience.

# To create the prototype, you need:

- Go to Figma and log in or sign up for an account.
- Start a new Figma file and set up your artboards for the various screens of your online pharmacy project.
- Design each screen of your online pharmacy application, considering layout, colors, typography, and interactive elements.
- Use the "Prototype" tab in Figma to link the screens and define interactions between them. Add transitions, gestures, and animations as needed.
- Use the Figma preview mode to test your prototype and ensure that all interactions work as intended.
- Share a link to your Figma prototype for others to review and interact with.
  
# Analysis:
The analysis involves the following :
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, removing duplicates records and encoding categorical features.
- Current Process Analysis
- Requirement Gathering
- Gap Analysis
- Future Workflow Analysis
- Interpretation: Interpreting the analysis's results and identifying the steps that need to be automated.

# Results:
The results include:
- Powerpoint presentation illustrating key findings.
- Recommendations: High Fidelity Figma Prototype .
